# Obrana – Securing Your Digital Legacy with Blockchain Inheritance

## 📌 Project Overview

**Obrana** is a blockchain-based inheritance platform designed to securely manage and automate the transfer of digital assets upon death. Built with legal compliance and smart contract automation, Obrana ensures that your digital wealth — including cryptocurrencies, NFTs, tokenized assets, and online business accounts — is safely passed on according to your wishes.

This project was initiated as part of the **Blockchain Development program at George Brown College**, and inspired by real-world challenges explored in the **Enterprise Blockchain Development** course.
